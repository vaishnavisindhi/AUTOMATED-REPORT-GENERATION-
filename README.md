PROJECT DISCRIPTION 

I was assigned a task to develop an automated report generation system using Python.
 The objective of this task was to create a self-contained script that reads or simulates data,
 performs basic analysis, and generates a formatted PDF report. I used the Python libraries pandas
 for data processing and reportlab for PDF generation. The script includes simulated data representing 
 sales, cost, and profit figures. It analyzes this data using summary statistics like mean, minimum,
 maximum, and standard devations 
 The PDF report was formatted with a title, intern details (name, date, organization), an introduction, 
 a summary statistics table, and a conclusion. The table was styled with colors, gridlines, and proper
 alignment using reportlab. Additionally, I included a feature in the script that checks for the required library (reportlab) 
 and installs it automatically if it is not present, ensuring that the script runs smoothly on any system.

The final output of this task was a report named sample_report.pdf, which showcases both the data analysis and the formatting skills.
